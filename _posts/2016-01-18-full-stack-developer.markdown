Help us build the future of Industrial Lighting with the IoT. We strongly believe in green energy and avoid wasting 
energy. We make lighting systems smart by gathering data and making them self-learning. We blend classic, proven 
technologies with the latest top notch technologies. You’re the one to take our product line beyond lighting: radiators, 
airconditioning, smart manufacturing, ...

We're a startup based in [Hasselt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hasselt) on the 
[Corda Campus](http://www.cordacampus.com/).

### Projects you’ll work on

* **Real-time dashboards**: create beautiful charts based on real-time data inbound from the lighting.
* **Connect hardware to the cloud**: our lighting is connected to the cloud, where everything is managed. Push new configurations, push new software, collect sensor data, etc.
* **Machine learning**: based on the data we receive from motion & light sensors, we extract behavioural patterns. This helps our customers to further optimize their energy usage and in the end, save money.
* **Automation**: manual work is error-prone. We focus on building products eliminating as much manual work as possible. Continuous integration, continuous delivery & continuous deployment is what we believe in.
* **A new IoT protocol**: we’re working on a new open standard for communication between the cloud and digital/analog products. 
* **Scaling**: we receive tons of data causing traffic to sometimes jam. We’re building our backend infrastructure as such that we’re resilient to this.

### Our Stack

Python/Django, Node.js, C++, AWS (IoT, Lambda, DynamoDB, ECS, Kinesis, Machine Learning, S3), BeagleBone, Docker, 
Angular 2, React.js, Webpack, Gulp

However, all of these technologies are interchangeable. We believe in continuously improving our stack and always 
deliberately select the right tool for the right job. 

### You ...
* believe that one day Elon Musk will fly to Mars and that you’ll be the guy that installs LED lights on the Red Planet.
* take ownership in your projects
* create art
* believe in the craft of software engineering, but are pragmatic and have the drive to make a positive change
* are flexible, proactive, and curious
* attend hackathons and/or tech conferences
* write code, hack and build stuff in your spare time
* know that the only thing that matters in technology is user experience
* automate a task as soon as you’ve had to do it twice
* value people over processes
* love to share knowledge and build cool stuff together
* are always in for a laugh
