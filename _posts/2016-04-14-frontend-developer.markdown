Help us build the future of Industrial Lighting with the IoT. We strongly believe in green energy and avoid wasting 
energy. We make lighting systems smart by gathering data and making them self-learning. We blend classic, proven 
technologies with the latest top notch technologies. You’re the one to take our product line beyond lighting: radiators, 
airconditioning, smart manufacturing, ...

We're a startup based in [Hasselt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hasselt) on the 
[Corda Campus](http://www.cordacampus.com/).

### Projects you’ll work on

* **Real-time dashboards**: create beautiful charts based on real-time data inbound from the lighting.
* **Shiny full-page interfaces**: crafted with the latest tools and trends in webdevelopment.
* **Mobile Apps**: we’re building apps to configure and manage our lights.

### Our Stack

Angular2, TypeScript, Webpack, Gulp, React.js, React Native, Node.js, SASS, Docker, Python, WebSockets, Reactive programming.

However, all of these technologies are interchangeable. We believe in continuously improving our stack and always 
deliberately select the right tool for the right job. 

### You ...
* believe that one day Elon Musk will fly to Mars and that you’ll be the guy that installs LED lights on the Red Planet.
* take ownership in your projects
* create art
* believe in the craft of software engineering, but are pragmatic and have the drive to make a positive change
* are flexible, proactive, and curious
* attend hackathons and/or tech conferences
* write code, hack and build stuff in your spare time
* know that the only thing that matters in technology is user experience
* automate a task as soon as you’ve had to do it twice
* value people over processes
* love to share knowledge and build cool stuff together
* are always in for a laugh
