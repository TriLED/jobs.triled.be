Help us build the future of Industrial Lighting with the IoT. We strongly believe in green energy and avoid wasting 
energy. We make lighting systems smart by gathering data and making them self-learning. We blend classic, proven 
technologies with the latest top notch technologies. With you, our products will go beyond lighting: radiators, airco, 
smart manufacturing, ...

We're a startup based in [Hasselt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hasselt) on the 
[Corda Campus](http://www.cordacampus.com/).

### Projects you’ll work on

* **Develop IoT hardware**: select the right components, draw the scheme and create an astounding PCB. 
* **Follow the LED**: following the latest trends on the LED market and work with state-of-the-art LEDs only.
* **Test tools**: know where a PCB can fail in production and create the hardware to detect the error.
* **Quality**: motivate our subcontractor to the next level, ensure they ship top-quality products only.

### Our Stack
ARM, digital electronics, analog electronics, radar sensors, LEDs, Altium, DECT, wireless communication, 
switched-mode power supply, ethernet and EMC

However, all of these technologies are interchangeable. We believe in continuously improving our stack and always 
deliberately select the right tool for the right job.  

### You ...
* believe that one day Elon Musk will fly to Mars and that you’ll be the guy that installs LED lights on the Red Planet.
* take ownership in your projects
* create art
* know how a 555 works
* believe in the craft of software engineering, but are pragmatic and have the drive to make a positive change
* are flexible, proactive, and curious
* attend hackathons and/or tech conferences
* write code, hack and build stuff in your spare time
* know that the only thing that matters in technology is user experience
* value people over processes
* love to share knowledge and build cool stuff together
* are always in for a laugh
