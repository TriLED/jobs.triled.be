Help us build the future of Industrial Lighting with the IoT. We strongly believe in green energy and avoid wasting 
energy. We make lighting systems smart by gathering data and making them self-learning. We blend classic, proven 
technologies with the latest top notch technologies. With you, our products will go beyond lighting: radiators, airco,
 smart manufacturing, ...

We're a startup based in [Hasselt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hasselt) on the 
[Corda Campus](http://www.cordacampus.com/).

### Projects you’ll work on

* **Software on lamps**: writing software in C to make our lighting smart. 
* **IoT stack**: writing advanced data capturing software in C++ to push our data to the cloud 
* **Automation**: manual work is error-prone. We focus on building products eliminating as much manual work as possible. Continuous integration, continuous delivery & continuous deployment is what we believe in.
* **A new IoT protocol**: we’re working on a new open standard for communication between the cloud and digital/analog products. 
* **Connect hardware to the cloud**: our lighting is connected to the cloud, where everything is managed. Push new configurations, push new software, collect sensor data, et

### Our Stack
C, C++, Cross Compiling, Embedded Linux, ARM, BOOST, DECT, TCP/IP, sockets, networking, POSIX and mutexes. 

However, all of these technologies are interchangeable. We believe in continuously improving our stack and always deliberately select the right tool for the right job. 

### You ...
* believe that one day Elon Musk will fly to Mars and that you’ll be the guy that installs LED lights on the Red Planet.
* take ownership in your projects
* create art
* know what an oscilloscope is
* believe in the craft of software engineering, but are pragmatic and have the drive to make a positive change
* are flexible, proactive, and curious
* attend hackathons and/or tech conferences
* write code, hack and build stuff in your spare time
* know that the only thing that matters in technology is user experience
* automate a task as soon as you’ve had to do it twice
* value people over processes
* love to share knowledge and build cool stuff together
* are always in for a laugh
